**Updates from last task**
We needed to optimize the Cavatica run with larger computing resources to accomodate running all 468 RNA-seq samples in one run. 

I changed the instance type to the  i3en.3xlarge 7.5 TB, since we have ~6TB of data (per Eric's recommendation)

We now get output where all BAM files are included in the final sashimi plots:

**Outstanding tasks**
1. plot PSI values of the splicing events on violin plots to see true distributions of PSI values between the two groups
