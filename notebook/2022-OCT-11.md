**Updates from last task**
- We needed to optimize the Cavatica run with larger computing resources to accomodate running all 468 RNA-seq samples in one run. 

- I changed the instance type to the  i3en.3xlarge 7.5 TB, since we have ~6TB of data (per Eric's recommendation)

- We now get output where all BAM files are included in the final sashimi plots:

- Need to made sure the group file is the corrected one 
``` 
High: 1-72 
Low: 73-469
```

- We also need to make sure that "spot instances" are turned off for the runs, so that the jobs ar enot prematurely terminated in less-prioritized machines 



**Outstanding tasks**
1. plot PSI values of the splicing events on violin plots to see true distributions of PSI values between the two groups 
2. Start looking at how splicing events may inform CDXX gene expression or protein
