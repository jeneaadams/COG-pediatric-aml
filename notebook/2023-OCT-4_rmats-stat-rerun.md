# Objective 
I am re-running rmats-turbo with stats off, them collectively with the stats mode on so that I can get a consensus estimate of the statistically significant splicing events BEFORE splitting the files into replicate groups. 

# Steps
- [x] Run rmats prep on Cavatica
- [x] Run rmats post on Cavatica
- [x] Download the post output to ``/mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG_rmats_out/2023OCT2_rmats-post/2023OCT2_rmats-post/``
- [ ] Run rMATS ``task --stat`` on the output
  - [x] move raw.inpu.*.txt and fromGTF*.txt files to the output directory of the stats step ``cp *.raw.input*.txt /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG_rmats_out/2023OCT4_stat-output_full/`` 
  - [ ] ~~``sbatch --time=3-0:0:0 --mem=32G /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG_rmats_out/scripts/_4_run-task-stat_COG.sh``~~
- [ ] For next comparison (NPM mutation status) extract bam files and run stats + filtering
  - [ ] 
- [ ] compare significant splicing event counts between old and new approach
- [ ] Move forward with NPM analysis 
  - [ ] run [SPARKS](https://github.com/Xinglab/sparks) to look at RBPs involved with signififanct splicing events
  - [ ] Gene expression analysis
  - [ ] 


# Workflow (focusing on NPM only for now) 
We're focusing on NPM only for now because it has the most promising splicing activity and potential targets in RBPs. 

## 2. (for cavatica) Subset the data into replicate groups from BAMS
🌐 environment = ``rmats2``
I did this already and copied the output, so I technically didn't need to do it again, but it just takes a second so I did it anyway.  

Command: 
```
python /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/kfAML_BAMs/_2_csv_indices_from_bams.py --input-csv _2_aggregated.csv --group1-bams /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG-analysis_metadataV2/npm-aml/npm-neg_bams_list.txt --group2-bams /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG-analysis_metadataV2/npm-aml/npm-pos_bams_list.txt
```

Output:

## 3. Stats part 1: prepare the stats input to modify th subset and create a new output directory 
📃 copy ``_3_prepare_stats_input.py`` to cwd. You may be able to run this in the current directory as long as the "old-ouput-dir" points ot the rmats output directory with the gtf files. But if unsure, copy this file to cwd.
