## Error updated 

As outlined in the [previous notes](https://github.com/jeneaadams/COG-Cavatica-pediatric-aml/blob/main/notebook/22-OCT-2021.md), there was an error cause by faulty file  transferring  which led to a failed post task. 

This error was corrected and the post task completed [succesfully](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/u/jiadams/cog-analysis/tasks/6915f713-fdd7-49d9-8325-be14f01ea2f5/) 

## Variability in runtime and cost 

I did notice a difference between my task and yours in runtime and cost.
Eric's took ~5.5 hours and cost $2.73. Mine took ~16.5 hours and cost $6.17.

Eric's explaination
> It looks like the difference is mostly from the time it took to get the .rmats files transferred to the machine running the job. Your files look like they're the same size as mine (which is expected) so I think the difference in time/cost is just because of network/disk IO which is out of our control
