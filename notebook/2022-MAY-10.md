**Recent updates**
We received metadata for 500 patients and discovered that about 250 of them had matached RNA-seq, WGS, and patient metadata. 

I have been visualizing and analyzing some of this in R. The main goal has ben to **recapitulate findings that Black patients have worse outcomes in AML**. 

Even with the limited data that we currently have, I've now pivoted to preparing to conduct a survival analysis on the patients. 

I initially started with just simple regression models and independence tests to see if there were significant differences in WBC or other quantiative features like time to first relapse between the racial groups. 
I also use tests to see if the clinical features could be predicted or clustered between the race categories. Nothing significant came up, but this could be because this is not the correct perspective to take ont his data. 

Enter survival analysis, which provides a well-established statistical framework for _estimating_ survival between populations.  

To do this, I'm reading currentl literature on basic survival analysis and familiarizing myself with tutorials of how to implement this better in R.  


**Current objectives**
1. Perform survival analysis on patient metadata

**Other Notes**

I've compiled papers and resourcs in the project's CHOP OneDrive folder which is shared with Kate, Yi, and Chun-jie: https://chop365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/adamsj8_chop_edu/Documents/COG-pediatric-AML?csf=1&web=1&e=WapBgK
