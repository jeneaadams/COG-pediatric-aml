1. the goal has been to process the high and low-risk pediatric AML patient groups through rMATS turbo. It was observed that the survival rates with significantly different between the two groups, and now we'd like to understand the splicing mechanisms that may be underlying that.

- Yi mentioned that instead of trying to edit Eric's scripts to manipulate rMATS output files and their metadata, just process all of the samples and use that processessed output to extract samples that I need into a splicing matrix. 
- I'm using [Yuanyuan's tutorial](https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats-turbo-tutorial)) as a baseline for how to process the data. 
- Of particular note is the section on processing significant splicing events from one large-scale dataset: 
    > Perform downstream analysis and visualization of rMATS-turbo results ∙ Timing ~ 30 min
    > 
    > 6. Select high-confidence alternative splicing events for the downstream analysis. The following criteria are recommended:
    > - Read coverage: average RNA-seq read count ≥ 20 across all 1,019 samples.
    > - PSI value: the 5% percentile of PSI values ≥ 0.05, and the 95% quantile of PSI values ≤ 0.95
