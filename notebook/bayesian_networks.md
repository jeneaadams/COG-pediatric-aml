# BREVE: (B)ayesian inference for (R)NA-informed (EV)aluation of Clinical (E)vents


## how 
To use a Bayesian network to understand the correlation between splicing, gene expression, RNA binding networks, and clinical phenotypes such as survival, relapse, and measurable residual disease, you can follow these steps:
Define the variables: Identify the variables of interest in your study, such as splicing, gene expression, RNA binding networks, and clinical phenotypes. Define the states of each variable, such as high or low expression levels, presence or absence of splicing events, and positive or negative clinical outcomes.
Determine the causal relationships: Determine the causal relationships between the variables. For example, splicing can affect gene expression, which can in turn affect RNA binding networks. Clinical outcomes may also be influenced by these variables.
Construct the Bayesian network: Once you have identified the variables and their relationships, you can construct a Bayesian network using a graphical model. The nodes in the network represent the variables, and the edges represent the causal relationships between them.
Estimate the probabilities: Using data from your study or prior knowledge, estimate the conditional probabilities for each variable given its parents in the network. These probabilities can be used to calculate the probability of different outcomes based on the observed values of the variables.
Interpret the results: Finally, interpret the results of the Bayesian network analysis. You can use the network to identify the most likely pathways that lead to clinical outcomes such as survival, relapse, and measurable residual disease. You can also use the network to identify potential targets for intervention or to develop predictive models for clinical outcomes.
Overall, a Bayesian network can be a powerful tool for understanding the complex relationships between splicing, gene expression, RNA binding networks, and clinical phenotypes. By modeling these relationships in a probabilistic framework, you can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions that may improve patient outcomes.

## bayesian network vs logistic regression 
Bayesian networks and logistic regression are both statistical methods used for modeling relationships between variables and predicting outcomes. However, there are some advantages of Bayesian networks over logistic regression:
Ability to model complex relationships: Bayesian networks can model complex relationships between variables that may be difficult or impossible to capture with logistic regression. This is because Bayesian networks allow for the modeling of direct and indirect causal relationships between variables, whereas logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between variables.
Incorporation of prior knowledge: Bayesian networks allow for the incorporation of prior knowledge or beliefs about the relationships between variables. This can be particularly useful in situations where there is limited data available or when the relationships between variables are not well understood.
Handling missing data: Bayesian networks can handle missing data more effectively than logistic regression. This is because Bayesian networks allow for the use of probabilistic inference to estimate missing values, whereas logistic regression typically requires complete data.
Flexibility in modeling categorical and continuous variables: Bayesian networks can model both categorical and continuous variables, whereas logistic regression is typically used for modeling categorical variables.
Ability to handle high-dimensional data: Bayesian networks can handle high-dimensional data with many variables, whereas logistic regression may struggle with high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality.
In summary, while logistic regression is a useful and widely used method for modeling relationships between variables and predicting outcomes, Bayesian networks offer several advantages in terms of their ability to model complex relationships, incorporate prior knowledge, handle missing data, and handle high-dimensional data.

## data integration 
Integrating PSI values from splicing data, gene expression from RNA-seq data, and gene ontology pathways into a Bayesian network to predict survival, relapse, or measurable residual disease is a complex problem that requires careful consideration of several factors, such as the size and complexity of the dataset, the available computational resources, and the desired performance metrics. Here is a high-level overview of how this integration might be accomplished:
Data preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the data by normalizing the gene expression data, identifying the differentially expressed genes, and computing the PSI values for the splicing data. Additionally, gene ontology pathways can be annotated to each gene using available resources such as the Gene Ontology database.
Feature selection: The next step is to select the most informative features from the data, such as the differentially expressed genes, the splicing events with the highest PSI values, and the gene ontology pathways that are most relevant to the disease of interest. This can be done using techniques such as chi-square test or information gain.
Bayesian network structure learning: The next step is to learn the structure of the Bayesian network using the selected features. This involves identifying the causal relationships between the variables and specifying the conditional probability tables that represent these relationships.
Model training and validation: Once the structure of the Bayesian network has been learned, the next step is to train the model using a training dataset and validate its performance using a separate validation dataset. This involves estimating the model parameters, such as the prior probabilities and the conditional probabilities, and evaluating the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Prediction and interpretation: Once the model has been trained and validated, it can be used to make predictions on new data, such as patients' gene expression and splicing data. The output of the model can be used to predict survival, relapse, or measurable residual disease, and the model parameters can be interpreted to gain insight into the underlying biological mechanisms that drive the disease.
Overall, integrating PSI values from splicing data, gene expression from RNA-seq data, and gene ontology pathways into a Bayesian network to predict survival, relapse, or measurable residual disease is a challenging but promising approach that can provide valuable insights into the underlying biology of the disease and help to guide clinical decision-making.

## using a bayesian network to parse out most important/influential features 
Yes, a Bayesian network can identify which features (also known as variables or nodes) are most likely to influence an outcome. In a Bayesian network, each node represents a variable and the edges between the nodes represent the causal relationships between the variables. By learning the conditional probability distributions between the nodes, a Bayesian network can identify which variables are most strongly associated with the outcome of interest.
One common approach for identifying the most influential features in a Bayesian network is to use sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis involves systematically perturbing the values of each variable in the network and observing the resulting changes in the probability of the outcome. By comparing the magnitude of these changes across different variables, it is possible to identify which variables have the greatest influence on the outcome.
Another approach is to use the concept of Markov blanket, which refers to the set of variables that are conditionally independent of the outcome given its direct causes. In other words, the Markov blanket of the outcome variable represents the minimal set of variables that need to be included in the network in order to accurately predict the outcome. By identifying the variables in the Markov blanket, it is possible to identify the most influential features in the network.
Overall, a Bayesian network can provide valuable insights into the relationships between variables and the factors that most strongly influence an outcome of interest.



## feature selection vs data integration 
Feature selection and data integration are related in the sense that both aim to identify a subset of relevant features from a larger set of variables. However, they differ in the scope of the variables being considered.
Feature selection is a process of selecting a subset of variables from within a single dataset that are most predictive of the outcome of interest. This is often done to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and to improve the performance of statistical models. Feature selection techniques include methods such as correlation analysis, mutual information, and regularization.
On the other hand, data integration involves combining information from multiple datasets, each of which may contain a different set of variables. Data integration aims to identify relationships between the variables across different datasets and to use this information to improve the accuracy and completeness of the analysis. Data integration techniques include methods such as canonical correlation analysis, factor analysis, and Bayesian network modeling.
In practice, feature selection and data integration are often used together in order to identify a subset of relevant features from multiple datasets. This can involve selecting a common set of features from each dataset prior to integration, or using integrated analysis methods that simultaneously perform feature selection and data integration. The goal is to identify a set of features that are relevant for predicting the outcome of interest, while minimizing the noise and redundancy in the data.

## using a bayesian network to understand co-regulated features 
Yes, a Bayesian network can be used to learn which features (also known as nodes or variables) are significantly correlated with one another. In a Bayesian network, the edges between the nodes represent the conditional dependencies among the variables. If two variables are strongly correlated with each other, this would be reflected by a strong positive or negative correlation coefficient in their joint probability distribution.
Learning the structure of a Bayesian network involves identifying which nodes are directly connected by edges, which can reveal the conditional dependencies among the variables. If two nodes are directly connected by an edge in the network, this implies that they are conditionally dependent on each other, given their parents in the network.
There are several algorithms for learning the structure of a Bayesian network from data, including constraint-based methods, score-based methods, and hybrid methods. Constraint-based methods typically rely on statistical tests for conditional independence to identify which edges in the network should be removed. Score-based methods, on the other hand, use a scoring metric to evaluate the fit of different network structures to the data. Hybrid methods combine elements of both constraint-based and score-based methods.
Once the structure of the Bayesian network has been learned, it is possible to analyze the network to identify which nodes are strongly correlated with each other. This can involve examining the conditional probability tables associated with each node, or performing sensitivity analysis to identify which nodes have the greatest influence on the values of other nodes in the network.

## comparing networks
To compare the architecture of Bayesian networks between several datasets or subsets of data, you can use several methods. Here are some suggestions:
Visual comparison: One way to compare Bayesian network architectures is to visually compare the network graphs of the datasets or subsets. You can use software packages such as bnviewer, bnlearn, or GeNIe to create network graphs and compare them side-by-side. This can give you a quick sense of the similarities and differences in the network architectures.
Structural similarity metrics: There are several structural similarity metrics that can be used to compare the similarity of Bayesian network structures. These metrics evaluate the similarity between two networks based on the number of shared edges, the strength of the edges, or the similarity of the conditional probability distributions. Examples of such metrics include the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the mutual information, and the Jaccard index.
Statistical testing: Another approach is to test whether the differences in the network structures between datasets or subsets are statistically significant. One way to do this is to use a permutation test to evaluate the null hypothesis that the network structures are the same across the datasets or subsets. You can compare the structure of the observed network to the distribution of network structures generated by randomly permuting the data.
Predictive performance: Finally, you can compare the predictive performance of the Bayesian networks trained on different datasets or subsets. You can use metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) or the accuracy to evaluate the predictive performance of the models. If the predictive performance of the models is similar, this may suggest that the differences in the network architectures are not important for the prediction task.

## encoding in a network features which you believe are most important 
Yes, you can encode a feature that you believe is the most important in a Bayesian network by setting it as the root node of the network. In a Bayesian network, the root node is the topmost node in the graph, and it represents the variable that is believed to be the most influential or causally related to other variables in the network.

If you have prior knowledge or strong evidence suggesting that a particular feature is the most important, you can set it as the root node of the Bayesian network and build the network structure around it. This can help you to better understand the conditional relationships among the variables and make more accurate predictions.

However, it is important to note that the Bayesian network structure is learned from data, and the root node should be chosen based on prior knowledge or strong evidence only if it is justified by the data. If the data suggest that another variable is more strongly related to the outcome, then this variable should be set as the root node instead. Therefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the data and use statistical methods to learn the structure of the Bayesian network rather than relying solely on prior knowledge or assumptions.

**what is if the root node of the network is chosen from genes that are both differentially spliced and show differential gene expression?**

## other ways to chose the root node 
Choosing a root node for a Bayesian network can be a critical step in building an accurate and interpretable model. Here are some general guidelines to help choose a root node:

Prior knowledge: If you have prior knowledge or strong evidence that a particular variable is causally related to the outcome or is the most influential variable in the system, you may want to set it as the root node of the Bayesian network. For example, if you are building a model to predict the likelihood of a disease, you might set the disease status as the root node.

Data-driven methods: You can also use data-driven methods to identify the root node of the Bayesian network. One approach is to calculate the conditional mutual information between each variable and the outcome, and choose the variable with the highest conditional mutual information as the root node. Another approach is to use a causal discovery algorithm, such as PC or FCI, to learn the structure of the Bayesian network and identify the root node.

Expert knowledge: If you don't have prior knowledge or the data-driven methods don't yield a clear choice for the root node, you may consult experts in the field to determine the most plausible root node. Experts may have domain-specific knowledge that can help identify the most important variable.

It's important to keep in mind that the choice of root node can affect the structure and interpretation of the Bayesian network, so it should be chosen carefully based on a combination of prior knowledge, data-driven methods, and expert opinion.


## crafting an "eigenvariable" that represents multiple vairables 
Yes, it is possible to use a conglomerate variable as the root node in a Bayesian network instead of a single variable, such as the expression of a single gene. A conglomerate variable can represent the combined effect of multiple variables, such as the expression of a set of genes, a pathway, or a biological process.

In practice, you can aggregate the expression levels of multiple genes or the values of multiple variables using a mathematical function, such as the mean or the principal component analysis (PCA), to create a conglomerate variable that captures the underlying biological process. This conglomerate variable can then be set as the root node of the Bayesian network, and the network structure can be learned from the data using standard methods.

Using a conglomerate variable as the root node can have several advantages. It can reduce the dimensionality of the data and simplify the model, making it easier to interpret and visualize. It can also capture the joint effects of multiple variables that may not be captured by a single variable.

However, it's important to note that creating a conglomerate variable requires careful consideration of the underlying biological process and the choice of mathematical function. In addition, the resulting Bayesian network may be less informative about the individual variables that contribute to the conglomerate variable, so it's important to balance the benefits and drawbacks of using a conglomerate variable as the root node.

## dealing with continuous variables in bayesian networks 
Yes, it is possible to build a Bayesian network that has continuous variables as input. One common approach is to use a discretization technique to convert the continuous variables into discrete variables, which can then be represented as nodes in the Bayesian network.

There are several discretization methods that can be used, including equal interval discretization, equal frequency discretization, and k-means clustering. These methods involve dividing the range of the continuous variable into intervals or clusters, and then assigning each observation to a discrete category based on its value.

Another approach is to use a Gaussian Bayesian network, which allows for continuous variables to be represented as nodes in the network without discretization. In a Gaussian Bayesian network, the conditional probability distributions between nodes are assumed to be Gaussian, and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution (mean and variance) are estimated from the data.

It's important to note that using continuous variables in a Bayesian network can increase the complexity of the model and may require more data to estimate the parameters accurately. It's also important to choose an appropriate discretization or modeling technique based on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data.

## testing for robustness 
Tests of robustness in statistical models are methods used to evaluate the stability and sensitivity of the model to changes in the data or assumptions.

One common test of robustness is sensitivity analysis, which involves varying one or more inputs or assumptions in the model to see how the outputs or conclusions of the model change. Sensitivity analysis can help to identify the impact of different sources of uncertainty or bias on the results of the model, and can help to identify areas where the model may need to be improved or adjusted.

Another test of robustness is cross-validation, which involves partitioning the data into training and validation sets and testing the model on the validation set. This can help to evaluate the generalizability and performance of the model on new or unseen data, and can help to identify any sources of overfitting or bias in the model.

Other tests of robustness may involve simulating data under different scenarios or assumptions, or comparing the results of the model to alternative models or methods. The goal of these tests is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the model under different conditions or assumptions, and to identify any sources of uncertainty or bias that may affect the conclusions of the model.

Overall, tests of robustness are important for ensuring that statistical models are reliable, accurate, and applicable to a wide range of conditions and assumptions.

## interpretability 
Real-world interpretability is a critical aspect of Bayesian networks, as they are often used in fields such as healthcare, finance, and engineering where decision-making based on model outputs can have significant consequences. Here are some ways to connect real-world interpretability in your Bayesian network:

Use meaningful variable names: Use variable names that are easily understandable by domain experts and stakeholders. This will make it easier for them to understand and interpret the model outputs.

Create visualizations: Use visualizations, such as graphs or diagrams, to display the structure of the Bayesian network and the relationships between variables. This will help stakeholders to see how different variables are connected and how they influence each other.

Provide explanations: Provide clear explanations of how the model works and how it produces its outputs. Explain the meaning of the probabilities and how they relate to the real-world problem being modeled.

Validate the model: Validate the model using real-world data and compare the model outputs to known outcomes or expert judgments. This will help to ensure that the model is producing valid and reliable results.

Involve domain experts: Involve domain experts and stakeholders throughout the modeling process to ensure that the model reflects their knowledge and understanding of the problem being modeled. This will help to ensure that the model is meaningful and relevant to real-world decision-making.

Perform sensitivity analysis: Perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate the robustness of the model to changes in inputs or assumptions. This will help stakeholders to understand how the model outputs might change in different scenarios.

Overall, connecting real-world interpretability in your Bayesian network requires careful consideration of the needs and perspectives of domain experts and stakeholders. By making the model outputs clear, understandable, and relevant to the problem being modeled, you can ensure that the model is a useful tool for real-world decision-making.

## parameter estimation 
The parameters of a Bayesian network refer to the values of the conditional probability tables (CPTs) for each node in the network. The CPTs specify the probabilities of a node's state given the states of its parent nodes.

In order to determine the parameters of your Bayesian network, you will need to learn them from data. This can be done using a process called parameter estimation or learning, which involves updating the CPTs based on observed data. There are several methods for parameter estimation in Bayesian networks, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP), and Bayesian estimation.

In MLE, the parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the observed data given the model. This involves computing the joint probability distribution of the data and the model, and finding the parameter values that maximize this distribution. In MAP estimation, a prior distribution is added to the likelihood function to encode prior knowledge or assumptions about the parameters. The parameters are then estimated by maximizing the posterior distribution given the observed data and the prior.

In Bayesian estimation, a prior distribution is specified for the parameters, and this distribution is updated based on the observed data using Bayes' rule. The resulting posterior distribution is used to compute the parameter estimates.

The specific method of parameter estimation you choose will depend on the nature of your data and the assumptions you are making about the model. In general, it is important to evaluate the performance of your Bayesian network on a validation set or through cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data, and to refine the parameter estimates as needed.
