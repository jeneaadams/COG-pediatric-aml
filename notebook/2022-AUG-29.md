**Last Updates**
Analysing the data with the rmats2sashimiplot app Since the files were now sorted intor their respective folders in the project COG_analysis (hirisk_bams, lowrisk_bams), I passed them to the rmats2sashimiplot tool in Cavatica.

I create the groupinfo text file and obtaine the filtered event file that was generated after the statistical model was run on the two replicate groups. I will also run with the up and downregulated splicing events.


**Today**
All tasks failed after running for over a day and being split into 4 groups. They ran out of disk space, and they were also not split in to otimal groups. 

Updates: 
- I needed to not only edit the groups I divided the bams in, but also increast the disk space. In update the groups in Cavatica, I realized that since the bams have a specific index with which the SE.MATS file is reference to obtain inclusion level information, and the actual order of the BAM files in Cavatica often gets sorted by name, that would cause an issue. Eric pointed out that this would create incorrect inclusion levels in the plot and proposed a few options:
  - fix this by re-running preapre_stats_input to re-obtain a new SE.MATS file by re-inputing the appropriate bam indices from the alphanumerically sorted cavatica list. This would involved further manipulation to intermediate files and would not be conducive to standardizing an approach for future analysis 
  - move forward and make the plots while ignoring the inclusion level, since the two groups we needed to split the low-risk replicates in (due two Cavatica's resoures allocation limits) would create two plot that have different inclusion levels, thus already eliminating consistent interpretability of the printed inclusion levels
  - Update the Cavatica app to be flexible for instances where we may have alphanumerically sorted bam files and still need proper indicies to maintain interpretable sashimiplots in Cavatica 

What we have decided to do is a combination of the last two: move forward with plot generation while ignoring the printed inclusion levels AND int he future, speak to the rest of the cloud tools team + Yi to get the greenlight for more time updating the rmats2sashimiplot Cavatica app for our analyses. This will be important because this isn't the only time we'll need to generate sashimi plots from our Cavatica data. If it were, the manual manipulation of intermediate files might be acceptable. However, the goal of this analysis is to not only obtain results, but to standardize an approach for analyzing data withi rmats tools in Cavatica. 

Therefore, I'm currently running two jobs with just three groups defined across two ```groupinfo.txt``` files. They also have **3000** parallel instances assigned to them via the Execution Settings tab in each of the tasks.
