## Differntial exon usage in COG AML dataset with sashimi lots
Today I'm working on creating [sashimi plots](https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats2sashimiplot) for a few driver genes in the pediatric COG AML dataset. 

I'm specifying a workflow I can use to repeat this analysis for other datasets in the future from working on the cloud.
