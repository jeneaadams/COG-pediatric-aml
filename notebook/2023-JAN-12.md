# rMATS Workflow - COG Analysis 

## Subprojects:
1. Risk groups rmats 
2. CBF-AML rmats
3. NPM-AML rmats
4. leukemic burden (WBC) rMATS
5. Other stats
  - Stats for high risk prevelenace in Black subgroup
  - Stats for leukemia burden prevalence in Black subgroup

## Workflow
1. Getting the rMATS output files from Cavatica

```
cd kf_python_api 
conda create --prefix ./cavatica-api-env
conda activate ./cavatica-api-env
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda python=3 
pip install git+https://github.com/kids-first/kf-cavatica-python-tools.git 
git clone https://github.com/kids-first/kf-cavatica-python-tools.git

cd kf_python_api #if needed

conda activate ./cavatica-api-env

python ./kf-cavatica-python-tools/recipes/download_files.py --project_name COG_analysis --project_path 2021OCT23_COG_rmats-output --download_location /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG-analysis_metadataV2/COG_rmats-output
```

2. ( FOR CAVATICA RUNS ) Subset the data into replicate groups from BAMs 

To do this, a CSV table with labeled rows is necessary. I downloaded this in the COG-pediatric-aml OneDrive folder as ```rna.pat.met_mergeUSI.csv```

Since I'm starting with the risk groups, I will sort the file by the risk group column and obtain the appropriate names. NOTE: this can also be automated in R. 

  - I will then copy these, paste into a text editor like VScode, and replace the spaces with commas. Then I will make this text file my new "Xrisk.txt" to which I will provide a path for ```_2_csv_indicese_from_bams.py```
  - After extracting an R CSV of the bam list for each subgroup, I copied the 'name' column input into VScode and added commmas at the end of each line (remove the one on the last line) 
  - Then I used ``` tr --delete '\n' < lowrisk_bams.txt > lowrisk_bams_list.txt ``` to remove all the **newlines** in the files and this gave me a file **list** file that I will use for the next step
    - I will repeat this for all subgroups, which will eventually be individual b1s and b2s
  - The files are locted in ```/mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG-analysis_metadataV2/``` for each project


🌐 environment = ```rmats2```
```
python /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/kfAML_BAMs/_2_csv_indices_from_bams.py --input-csv _2_aggregated.csv --group1-bams /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG-analysis_metadataV2/risk-groups/lowrisk_bams_list.txt --group2-bams /mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/COG-analysis_metadataV2/risk-groups/highrisk_bams_list.txt
```
    - This is originally located in ```/mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/kfAML_BAMs/_2_csv_indices_from_bams.py```
    - 📃 Copy _2_aggregated.csv to the cwd from the rmats output folder
    - The output should print to the terminal -- copy and paste the indices for step 3
    
Output:

3. ( FOR CAVATICA RUNS ) Stats part 1: prepare the stats input to modify the subset and create a new output directory 

  - 📃 copy ```_3_prepare_stats_input.py``` to cwd

You may be able to run this in the current directory as long as the "old-ouput-dir" points ot the rmats output directory with the gtf files.
