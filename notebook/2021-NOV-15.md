## New plan: Running PEGASAS on the kids first AML data
Tutorial

### Gene expression data 
PEGASAS uses gene expression data to quantify gene expresion by sample. Since the KF AML data already had kallisto run on it, I plan to wrangle this data and produce a gene expression matrix that PEGASAS can use: 
> TSV format matrix of gene expression values (FPKM,
                        TPM, etc.), where each row is one sample and each
                        column is one gene
                       
### Splicing quantification with rMATS output of KF AML data 
Since I already have outputs of rMATS-turbo for the 1113 samples, I'd like to generate sashimi plots for key driver genes on this data and begin comparing that to what is observe in the adult AML data (TCGA) and potentially publically-avaialble data (beatAML). 

#### generating sashimi plots for specici genes
>For example, if you are interested in gene GRIN1, you can directly extract lines with this gene from rmats-turbo output. A simple way of doing this is to use grep in bash:
```grep GRIN1 SE.MATS.JC.txt```
