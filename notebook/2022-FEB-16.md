# Today's goals 

* run rMATS output analysis on kf AML data 
* prepare for Xing lab cloud tools meeting

# Today's challenges 
* While using Beatrice's instructions for creating a PSI matrix from IRIS code, I realized I needed the KF AML BAM files to be on the HPC so that I could create the appropriate sample list file for the PSI matrix
  - In order to do this, I needed to re-run the CAVATICA API script to retreive all 1113 BAMs 
    - While doing this, I realized I needed to submit a job for this task of downloading 1113 files, which will be about 10TB of data. 
    - I created a BASH script to submit a ```slurm``` job located at ```/mnt/isilon/xing_lab/aspera/adamsj/kfAML_BAMs/bam_files/kfAML_bam_transfer.sh```


# Today's outcomes 
* get EMT BAM files from GEO, not others in the lab: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112037
