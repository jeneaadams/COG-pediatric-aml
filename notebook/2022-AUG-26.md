**Updates: Creating a script for sorting Cavatica files**

I created a script called sort_files_cavatica.py that can effectively can any list of files and sort them accordingly in Cavatica for downstream use. Most importantly, it can take a list of bam files from specific replicate groups, sort them, label them, and have them in project directories for use with rmast2sashimiplot. 

```python sort_files_cavatica.py --project_name cog-analysis --project_path bam_files --project_id jiadams/cog-analysis --new_folder_name test --tag test_tag --list highrisk_bam_IDs.txt```

- ```--project_name```: Cavatica project name (i.e. cog-analysis)
- ```--project_path```: Cavatica project path where it will look for the files to match (i.e. bam_files)
- ```--project_id```: Cavatica project ID (i.e. jiadams/cog-analysis)
- ```--new_folder_name```: Name of the new folder that's created
- ```--tag```: How you want to tag each file within the new folder
- ```--list```: the list of Cavatica file IDs that it will look for in your project_path folder


**Analysing the data with the rmats2sashimiplot app**
Since the files were now sorted intor their respective folders in the project COG_analysis (hirisk_bams, lowrisk_bams), I passed them to the rmats2sashimiplot tool in Cavatica.

I create the groupinfor text file and obtaine the filtered event file that was generated after the statistical model was run on the two replicate groups. I will also run with the up and downregulated splicing events.
