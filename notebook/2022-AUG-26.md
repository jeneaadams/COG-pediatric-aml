**Updates**

I created a script called sort_files_cavatica.py that can effectively can any list of files and sort them accordingly in Cavatica for downstream use. Most importantly, it can take a list of bam files from specific replicate groups, sort them, label them, and have them in project directories for use with rmast2sashimiplot. 

```python sort_files_cavatica.py --project_name cog-analysis --project_path bam_files --project_id jiadams/cog-analysis --new_folder_name test --tag test_tag --list highrisk_bam_IDs.txt```
