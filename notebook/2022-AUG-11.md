**Recent updates**
- Submitted jobs to complete the filtering step, but they kept getting killed 
  - I submitted 200G last 
  - ```sacct -j 60509221 --format=ReqMem``` shows how much memory was actually alloted to the job 
  - SOLUTION: needed to out ```--mem=XXG``` BEFORE the script name 
  - script worked with ```sbatch --mem=16G run_postprocessing_kfAML.sh```

**Next Steps**

- [x] To complete the filtering step
- [ ] (if there's time) create a pie chart to visualize all of the splicing events 
- [ ] subset the data into high and low risk groups from the check metadata script 
- [ ] run the stats mode on the high and low risk groups
