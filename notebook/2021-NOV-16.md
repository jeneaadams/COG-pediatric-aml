### Gene expression data 
PEGASAS uses gene expression data to quantify gene expresion by sample. Since the KF AML data already had kallisto run on it, I plan to wrangle this data and produce a gene expression matrix that PEGASAS can use: 
> TSV format matrix of gene expression values (FPKM,
                        TPM, etc.), where each row is one sample and each
                        column is one gene
                        
Using this vignette to import count data for a matrix: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/tximport/inst/doc/tximport.html#kallisto
